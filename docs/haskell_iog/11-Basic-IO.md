::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## Pure functions
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
So far, we\'ve been working with pure functions. These functions have no
side effects and take all their arguments as input and produce a value
as an output that depends only on those arguments.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_purefunc_generic.png"
  style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: 20%;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 64%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
What we mean by input and output is crucial here. A function\'s input
can be only the values we provide as arguments, and its output is the
value it returns.

For example:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_purefunc_lame.png"
  style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 60%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `lame` function takes a single numeric parameter and returns the
value multiplied by three. The output of this function depends
exclusively on the value we provide as input. So, every time we apply
this `lame` function to four, we\'ll get twelve.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_purefunc_max6.png"
  style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 60%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Even if we don\'t explicitly show the input of `max6`, we know that
because `filter` is partially applied, it takes a list of `Integers`. (I
simplified the signature a bit.) Same as before, the output depends
exclusively on the value we provide as input. So, every time we apply
this `max6` function to the same list, we\'ll get the same result.

And, of course, functions are curried. So if a function looks like it
takes multiple arguments, it actually takes a single parameter and
returns a function that takes another single parameter, and so on, until
all parameters are applied, and we get the final value. If we use the
same parameters, we get the same result. And in every intermediate step,
we also get the same intermediate result.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
All good so far. But what if we don\'t have the input yet?

What if we want to make an interactive program? A website? Or a game?
When we write our program, we have no idea what the user will do with
it. We can\'t know in advance if a player in our game will move to the
left or right. Or if a user on our website will click on a specific
button or not.

Those things happen while running the program, so there\'s no way for
the programmer to pass them as inputs of a function.

I mean, we could, but imagine if we chose them beforehand. A game that
always does and finishes the same way. Without any way for the player to
interact with it. That sounds more like a movie. Still not bad. Until
you realize that you can\'t even show the image on the screen because
that would entail sending and receiving information from your
computer\'s screen while running the program. So, if you run this
\"game,\" you\'re basically using your computer as a very expensive
heater.

The only way to provide our program with the information and
capabilities it needs is to give it a method to interact with the real
world.

And for that, Haskell uses IO actions.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## Introduction to IO Actions
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Before starting with IO actions, I\'ll address the elephant in the room.
I just told you that everything we coded so far was pure, and we
couldn\'t interact with it. But we\'ve been interacting with our
functions and passing arguments since lesson one! That\'s because we\'ve
been cheating by using GHCi, which performs IO actions in the background
without explicitly telling us. So, at the end of the day, if we want our
program to interact with the real world, we still need IO actions.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
***IO action* (or just *action*/*computation*)** can interact with and
change the world outside our program.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The name IO action gives room for misinterpretation. When we talk about
IO actions, we\'re not talking about the input and output of the
function. We talk about the input and output between our program and the
real world. IO actions can interact with and change the world outside
our program. They might or might not interact with the world, but they
CAN. That\'s key. They are **allowed** to interact with the world.

These IO actions are what we call a side effect.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
**A side effect is any observable effect other than the effect of
returning a value.**
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
That\'s why all the functions we\'ve written so far have been pure. The
only thing they did was to return a value. It might sound a bit
abstract, so let\'s see a few examples so we can build up our intuition:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
-   Obtain the result of what a person typed on the keyboard.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_keyboard.png" style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 55%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Notice that IO actions are on top of the diagram. We represented
functions with boxes that took their inputs from the left and returned
the outputs on the right. But now that we\'re dealing with actions, we
indicate side effects at the top of the diagram with arrows going both
in and out because side effects can both send and receive information.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
-   Show some text, an image, or something on the screen.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_screen.png" style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 55%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
-   Call an API or a database (it doesn\'t really matter what you do).
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_api.png" style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 65%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Ok, so we are clear about the idea of IO actions. But how does Haskell
handle those IO actions?
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## IO actions under the hood
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Now, I\'m going to show you the definition of the type that alows us to
safely interact with the real world using IO actions. A heads up! Don\'t
try to understand the code. We\'ll only use it to create a mental model
of what\'s happening under the hood.

Without further ado, here\'s the `IO` type:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
newtype IO a = IO (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #))
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `IO` type constructor has a single `IO` value constructor.

The interesting part is the function passed as a parameter of the value
constructor. It takes the state of the real world, does something to it,
and returns a tuple containing the new state of the real world and a
value of type `a` that was generated while all that was happening.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Aren\'t the designers of Haskell a bunch of smarty-pants? If you give a
function the state of the whole real world, that function can do
anything! Talk to databases, access files on your computer, allow
penguins to fly, anything!

We\'ll use it to print stuff on the screen, though.

Of course, this is not what is really happening under this seemingly
magical type. But we can think of it this way. The IO type is actually
an abstract type.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
**An abstract data type is a type whose representation is hidden 🫣 but
provides associated operations.**
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
So, the inner workings of IO are hidden. And instead, we get a bunch of
functions and actions that use this type. Which means:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
**We don\'t use the IO constructor directly. We use functions and
actions that operate with IO values.**
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
So there you go, that\'s as far as we\'re going to go about this. If you
want to know more, there are tons of tutorials out there, or you could
even explore the source code itself! But I\'d recommend waiting until
you\'re more fluent in Haskell to tackle that challenge.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Now, let\'s switch to the practical side. In practice, we don\'t care
about the details of how the interaction with the real world is handled.
We don\'t even care about how the `IO` type is defined! The only thing
we care about is that, if we use it properly, the compiler will handle
the details, and we won\'t get any surprises when running our code. So
let\'s learn how to properly use the `IO` type.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## IO actions in practice
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_something.png"  style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 55%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `IO a` type tells us that `something` is an IO action that first
interacts with the real world and then returns a value of type `a`.

For example:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
action1 :: IO Bool             -- Performs IO and returns a Bool

action2 :: IO Int              -- Performs IO and returns an Int

action3 :: IO (Double -> Char) -- Performs IO and returns a function

action4 :: IO ()               -- Performs IO and returns ()
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
There are three key things to note here:

1.  One is that, after performing the action, we get a VALUE of the
    specified type we can use in our code.
2.  The other is that the action returns a value AFTER performing the IO
    action. We CAN NOT get that value without interacting with the real
    world.
3.  And finally, we see a new type in the last action: The unit type.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
### The unit type
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This is the unit type:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
data () = ()
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We see that it has only one value constructor that takes no parameters
(also called a nullary constructor). So, it\'s a type that has only one
possible value (`()`). Also, notice that the type and the value have the
same name.

But wait! Why do we learn about this just now? Well, because, until now,
we\'ve been working with pure functions. If the only thing a pure
function does is to return `(),` why do you even bother to use that
function? Just use the value directly! And if a function takes the unit
value as a parameter, why do you even bother requiring it if it\'s
always the same value? Just remove that parameter and use the unit
inside the function directly!

So, when you think about it, we could remove the unit type from any pure
function and lose nothing. BUT! Now that we\'re dealing with actions and
side effects, there are plenty of cases when we don\'t care about what
the action returns as a value because we care only about the side effect
it performs. Take printing something on the screen or deleting a file.
We don\'t need something in return. We care only about the side effect.

That\'s why, now, it makes sense to have this type. To represent a value
that we don\'t care about.

If it doesn\'t quite click, don\'t worry, we\'ll see a couple of
real-life examples during this lesson. Let\'s start wit how to retrieve
the input from a user.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## Interacting with the real world (`getChar`, `getLine`, and `putStrLn`)
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The most basic IO action I can think of is `getChar`:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_getChar.png"  style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 55%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This function performs the IO action of asking the user to write a
single character on the standard input. As soon as the user writes that
character, it takes it and finishes the IO action. The value of type
`Char` it returns is the character the user wrote. We can run the
function here to see how that looks.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="17" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
-- getChar :: IO Char
getChar
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetChar: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
As you can see, when we run this cell, a text area appears so we can
input a character. There\'s still some magic going on because we\'re
using these Jupyter cells that run GHCi under the hood as training
wheels. But we\'ll get rid of them soon enough.

Now, there are cases when a single character is enough, like when you
need to confirm or deny an action in a CLI. But what about a whole
phrase? For that, we can use another function called `getLine`:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_getLine.png"  style="
  display:block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 55%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This one performs the IO action of asking the user to write a line on
the standard input. And the value of type `String` it returns is the
text the user wrote until it pressed Enter.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="4" scrolled="true" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
-- getLine :: IO String
getLine
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `getChar` and `getLine` functions are great and all. But, if we run
a program with just these, it will prompt us for a character or string
without any explanation. Like when your dog suddenly stands in front of
you and silently but intensely stares at you with puppy eyes. You know
it wants something, but what?

Not only do we need a way to get but also to send messages to the
outside world. And for that, we use `putStrLn`:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_putStrLn.png"  style="
  display:block;
  margin-top:5%;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 70%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
`putStrLn` is a function that takes a string as input and returns an IO
action. And what does the action returned by `putStrLn` do?
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
```{=html}
<hr/>
```
`<img src="../images/diagram_IO_putStrLn_Hi.png"  style="
  display:block;
  margin-top:5%;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 55%;"/>`{=html}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
It prints the `String` we previously passed as a parameter to the
standard output.

As an example:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="20" scrolled="true" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
putStrLn "Hello World from inside the program!"
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    Hello World from inside the program!
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
In this case, `putStrLn` is applied to the `String` and returns an
action of type `IO ()`. Then, because we\'re using a Jupyter notebook,
it automatically performs the action, and we get the `String` in our
standard output below the cell.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
But check this out:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="21" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
x = putStrLn "Hello World from inside the program!" 
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
If we run the last cell, we don\'t get the `String` in our standard
output. That\'s because we didn\'t ask for the action to be performed.
We just named it `x`, and that\'s it. We never actually need the action
to be performed, so Haskell didn\'t perform it.

And that\'s another property of actions. They are what in programming
are called first-class values.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## Actions are first-class values
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
It means that you can treat actions the same as any other value. For
example:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="23" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
-- putStrLn is an example of a function that returns an action


-- Bind to names
x = putStrLn "Hello World from inside the program!"


-- Put them inside lists or other data structures
listOfActions :: [IO ()]
listOfActions = [putStrLn "a", putStrLn "b"]


-- Pass them as function parameters
fakeLength :: [IO ()] -> Int
fakeLength list = 1 + length list
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
And, if we run the `fakeLenghth` function passing the `listOfActions` as
parameters\...
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="24" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
fakeLength listOfActions
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    3
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We don\'t get any of the messages in the standard output because none of
the actions inside the list are performed! Why should they be performed?
We just asked about the length of the list, not the values it contains.
Remember that Haskell is lazier than a cat sunbathing. It won\'t do
anything unless it has to.

So, until they are performed, IO actions are just plans to do something,
programs to be run, or actions to be performed. And because the side
effects aren\'t performed while evaluating all those expressions, we can
keep reasoning about our code like we\'re used to. And only care for the
actual side effects when we ask Haskell to perform them.

So, how can we ask Haskell to perform a few different actions? By
composing them with special operators.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## Composing IO actions (`>>` and `>>=` operators) {#composing-io-actions--and--operators}
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We\'ll create a few simple bots to learn how to compose IO actions
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### Rude bot
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The first one is a rude bot. As soon as you interact with it, it yells
at you.

It starts with a simple message:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="25" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBot :: IO ()
rudeBot = putStrLn "Hey!"

rudeBot
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    Hey!
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The bot has to catch its breath before yelling at you again, so we\'ll
add the next phrase in a second action. To do that, we\'ll introduce the
\"then\" operator:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This is a specialized signature specifically for IO actions. And as you
can see, the operator takes two actions as inputs: `IO a` and `IO b`. It
first executes `IO a`, ignores the result (whatever this `a` is), and
returns the `IO b` action.

If this were a pure operator, the implementation would look like this:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="28" scrolled="true" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
pureThen :: a -> b -> b
x `pureThen` y = y


3 `pureThen` 5

3 `pureThen` 5 `pureThen` 6 `pureThen` 'a'
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    5
:::

::: {.output .display_data}
    'a'
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We\'d be just throwing away the first value and returning the second.

But! Because we\'re dealing with IO actions, this operator has some
secret sauce that allows it to perform the first IO action before
returning the second one. More specifically:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
```

**The `>>` operator sequentially composes two actions, discarding any
value produced by the first.**
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
For example:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="31" scrolled="false" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
abc :: IO ()
abc = putStrLn "a" >> putStrLn "b" >> putStrLn "c"

abc
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    a
    b
    c
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
`abc` is an action composed by multiple actions.

When we ask Haskell to perform the `abc` action, it first performs the
`putStrLn "a"` action and discards the result, then performs the
`putStrLn "b"` action and discards the result, and finally, performs the
`putStrLn "c"` action and returns whatever the last action returns. So,
because `putStrLn "c"` returns the unit after the side effects, the
`abc` action also returns the unit after the side effects.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The direction of the arrows indicates the direction of the sequence. We
perform actions from left to right.

Now, let\'s use this operator to finish the rude bot:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="30" scrolled="true" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBot :: IO ()
rudeBot = putStrLn "Hey!" >> putStrLn "Get out of my lawn!"

rudeBot
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    Hey!
    Get out of my lawn!
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Exactly what we wanted!

But maybe we could make it even ruder.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### An even ruder bot
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
How could we make this bot more annoying? Hmm\... I know! Let\'s make it
seem interested in us and then yell at us! So it also wastes our time.

So, we\'ll make the bot ask our name, completely ignore it, and then
yell at us. All that with this simple code:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="32" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
evenRuderBot :: IO ()
evenRuderBot =
  putStrLn "What's your name?"            -- IO ()
    >> getLine                            -- IO String
    >> putStrLn "like I care! Get lost!"  -- IO ()
    
evenRuderBot
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
It\'s getting a bit too long, so we\'ll split it into several lines.

Besides that, not much has changed. The only real change is that we
added a `getLine` function between the `putStrLn` ones. But if we run it
now, we see that

1.  First, it performs the side effect of asking for our name in the
    standard output.
2.  Then, it performs the side effect of waiting for us to type it and
    returning that as a value. But because we\'re using the `>>`
    operator, we ignore it.
3.  And finally, it sends the last message.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
It\'s definitely ruder than before, but maybe we took it too far. Let\'s
learn how to use the value returned by `getLine` by taking our rude bot
to therapy.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### Rude bot after therapy
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
After therapy, our bot feels way better and wants to be our friend. And
for that, it has to use our name. We can\'t use the `>>` operator cause
that ignores it. So, we need another operator that does the same but
passes the result of the first action to the second one. And that\'s the
\"bind\" operator.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This is also a specialized signature for IO actions. It looks
complicated, but it\'s not that different from the `>>` operator.

This operator takes an `IO a` action and a function that takes a value
of the same type `a` as the one produced by the first action and returns
another action, `IO b`.

What this operator does, is: It performs the IO action to get the value
`a`, then passes that value to the function to get the `IO b` action,
and returns that as a result. The operator does not perform the `IO b`
action, just the `IO a` action.

So:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
**The `>>=` operator sequentially composes two actions, passing any
value produced by the first as an argument to the second.**
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
For example:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="37" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
-- Remainders:
-- (>>=) :: IO a  -> (a -> IO b)  -> IO b
-- getLine :: IO String


yellIt :: String -> IO ()
yellIt str = putStrLn (str ++ "!!!!!!")

yellItBack :: IO ()
yellItBack = getLine >>= yellIt

yellIt "Hey"
--yellItBack
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    Hey!!!!!!
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
As you can see, we have the `yellIt` function that takes a String and
returns the action of printing that string with a bunch of exclamation
marks.

And in the `yellItBack` function, we perform the action of `getLine`
that returns a String. But instead of throwing the string away, this
time, we use the `>>=` operator to pass it as the parameter of `yellIt`.
`yellIt` returns that action, and because it\'s the last one, it gets
evaluated too. Sending the outside world the same message but with more
emphasis.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Now, let\'s use this operator on the---now nicer---bot:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
response :: String -> IO ()
response name = putStrLn $ "Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!"

rudeBotAfterTherapy :: IO ()
rudeBotAfterTherapy =
  putStrLn "What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= response
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We create the `rudeBotAfterTherapy` function that first asks for your
name. Then, it waits for you to provide it. And after you do, it passes
that value to the `response` function that uses it to print a message.

It works, but the `response` function is a simple function that we only
use once. And we already know what to do in these cases. We use a lambda
function:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="45" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBotAfterTherapy :: IO ()
rudeBotAfterTherapy =
  putStrLn "What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= (\name -> putStrLn $ "Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
    

rudeBotAfterTherapy
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
There you go! A simple and compact function with just a little bit of
noise.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### Now it\'s a chatty bot!
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Our bot is now completely rehabilitated, and it turns out it\'s a chatty
bot! Let\'s add a few chatty features!

For example, let\'s add another message that tells us the number of
letters our name has:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="39" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
lettersInName :: String -> String
lettersInName name =
  "Your name has "
    ++ show (length name)
    ++ " letters, in case you where wandering..."
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `lettersInName` function is a pure function that takes a name and
returns a silly little comment on it. To add it to our chatty bot, we
need to do it like this:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="42" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
chattyBot :: IO ()
chattyBot =
  putStrLn "Hey! What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= ( \name ->
            putStrLn ("Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
              >> putStrLn (lettersInName name)
        )


chattyBot
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We need the value `name` (provided as the result of the second action),
so we need to compose our action inside that lambda function.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
And now it\'s more of the same. We can keep adding more and more actions
in the same way. Here\'s something a bit more complicated:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="43" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
finalChattyBot :: IO ()
finalChattyBot =
  putStrLn "Hey! What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= ( \name ->
            putStrLn ("Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
              >> putStrLn (lettersInName name)
              >> putStrLn ("So, " ++ name ++ ", what do you do for fun?")
              >> getLine
              >>= ( \hobby ->
                      putStrLn ("Are you kidding, " ++ name ++ "! I love " ++ hobby ++ "!")
                  )
        )
    >> putStrLn "OK, bye!"


finalChattyBot
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
As you can see, if we keep increasing the interactions, we start to see
a pattern. An ugly and hard-to-read pattern.

Luckily, we have a sweeter alternative. Enter the \"Do Notation\":
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## The `do` notation
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `do` notation is just syntactic sugar for expressions composed by
`>>` an `>>=` operators.

We\'re going to rewrite all the previous expressions with do notation so
we can see the difference. Starting with the rude bot:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="45" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBot :: IO ()
rudeBot = putStrLn "Hey!"

rudeBotDo :: IO ()
rudeBotDo = do
    putStrLn "Hey!"


rudeBotDo
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    Hey!
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
As you can see, we write the keyword `do` after the equal sign. And
then, we start a block with the actions.

In this case, this syntax is not useful. It\'s more straightforward to
write it without the `do` syntax!

Let\'s see the second version of the rude bot:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="46" scrolled="true" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBot :: IO ()
rudeBot = putStrLn "Hey!" >> putStrLn "Get out of my lawn!"

rudeBotDo :: IO ()
rudeBotDo = do 
    putStrLn "Hey!"
    putStrLn "Get out of my lawn!"


rudeBotDo
```

::: {.output .display_data}
    Hey!
    Get out of my lawn!
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Now we start to see some slight improvement. It\'s not much, but we can
see that each action is in a different line, making it easier to
identify.

Without the `do` notation, the actions go from left to right. With the
`do` notation, they go from top to bottom.

And what about the even ruder bot?
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
evenRuderBot :: IO ()
evenRuderBot =
  putStrLn "What's your name?"  
    >> getLine  
    >> putStrLn "like I care! Get lost!"
    
    
evenRuderBotDo :: IO ()
evenRuderBotDo = do
  putStrLn "What's your name?"  
  getLine  
  putStrLn "like I care! Get lost!"
    
evenRuderBotDo
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Same as before, add the `do` keyword, remove the `>>` operators, and
you\'re ready to go. Notice that now we\'re aligning everything at the
same indentation level.

Now is when the cool stuff starts. Here we have the rude bot after
therapy:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBotAfterTherapy :: IO ()
rudeBotAfterTherapy =
  putStrLn "What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= (\name -> putStrLn $ "Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
How do we handle the `name`? In the previous bot, we ignored it, but now
we need a way to bind the result of `getLine` to a name. For that,
we\'ll introduce the `<-` (left arrow or bind):
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
rudeBotAfterTherapyDo :: IO ()
rudeBotAfterTherapyDo = do
  putStrLn "What's your name?"
  name <- getLine -- (getline :: IO String) so (name :: Sring)
  putStrLn $ "Nice to meet you, " ++ name


rudeBotAfterTherapyDo
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This left arrow binds the result of running the `putStrLn` action to
`name`. And once you have the `name` variable, you can use it anywhere
after that action.

Now let\'s see how we can use do notation for the chatty bot:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="47" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
chattyBot :: IO ()
chattyBot =
  putStrLn "Hey! What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= ( \name ->
            putStrLn ("Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
              >> putStrLn (lettersInName name)
        )


chattyBotDo :: IO ()
chattyBotDo = do
  putStrLn "Hey! What's your name?"
  name <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
  putStrLn $ lettersInName name


chattyBotDo
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Now the differences start to get big! You have to stop on `chattyBot`
for a few seconds to grasp what it\'s doing, but `chattyBotDo` is really
easy to follow!

Finally, let\'s compare the most complicated one:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
finalChattyBot :: IO ()
finalChattyBot =
  putStrLn "Hey! What's your name?"
    >> getLine
    >>= ( \name ->
            putStrLn ("Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
              >> putStrLn (lettersInName name)
              >> putStrLn ("So, " ++ name ++ ", what do you do for fun?")
              >> getLine
              >>= ( \hobby ->
                      putStrLn ("Are you kidding, " ++ name ++ "! I love " ++ hobby ++ "!")
                  )
        )
    >> putStrLn "OK, bye!"


finalChattyBotDo :: IO ()
finalChattyBotDo = do
  putStrLn "Hey! What's your name?"
  name <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Nice to meet you, " ++ name ++ "!")
  putStrLn (lettersInName name)
  putStrLn ("So, " ++ name ++ ", what do you do for fun?")
  hobby <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Are you kidding, " ++ name ++ "! I love " ++ hobby ++ "!")
  putStrLn "OK, bye!"
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Always keep all the statements aligned at the same indentation level to
avoid confusing the compiler and having silly errors.

As you can see, the `do` notation is nice to read and write! It allows
for a more clean and concise code. But waaaaait a minute! This code
looks oddly imperative! We\'re stating what to do step by step in
sequence! Wasn\'t it that declarative code was so great?

Until now, all the functions we wrote were pure, which means that, we\'d
always have the same result, no matter the order of evaluation. That\'s
why we could write declarations and let the compiler handle the details.

Now that we have side effects, the order in which things happen matters!
We don\'t want to run the side effect of getting the name before the one
that prints the \"What\'s your name?\" question. That\'s why we adopt a
more imperative style with the do notation.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
That\'s the do notation, in essence. But there are a few other things
regarding the practical aspect of using the `do` notation. It gets a bit
more complicated, but not much.

Let\'s start with how to use `let` inside the `do` notation:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### Using `let` inside the `do` notation
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We can use the `let` keyword inside a `do` block like this:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
unscramble :: IO ()
unscramble = do
  putStrLn "Write a bunch of numbers and letters scrambled together:"
  arg <- getLine
  let numbers = filter (`elem` "1234567890") arg
      letters = filter (`notElem` numbers) arg
  putStrLn $ "Numbers: " ++ numbers
  putStrLn $ "Letters: " ++ letters


unscramble
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
There are a few details to keep in mind:

-   The constructs bounded with the `let` keyword are lazy. So, even
    though they occupy a line in the do block, they aren\'t evaluated
    unless needed somewhere else.
-   We don\'t need the `in` keyword like we do outside the `do`
    notation. Everything after the let binding can access it. Sames as
    the variables bounded using the left arrow.
-   If you have a couple of `let` bindings one after the other. The
    `let` keyword is needed only for the first one, and you have to
    maintain all on the same indentation level. It is not mandatory to
    use this feature (you can write `let` for every single one), but
    it\'s convenient.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This `let` binding syntax is pretty convenient. Same as the ability to
nest `do` blocks.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### Nesting `do` blocks
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
We can nest do blocks as much as we want. For example:
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="49" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
plusADecade :: IO ()
plusADecade = do
  putStrLn "What is your age?:"
  ageString <- getLine
  let validAge = all (`elem` "1234567890") ageString
  if validAge
    then do
      let age = read ageString :: Int
      putStrLn $ "Int 10 years you will be " ++ show (age + 10) ++ " years old."
    else do
      putStrLn "Your age should contain only digits from 0-9. (Press CTRL+C to close)"
      plusADecade



plusADecade
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `plusADecade` function first asks for the age of the user. Then it
checks that the String provided by the user contains only numbers. If it
does, we use the `read` function to get the numeric representation, add
10 to it, and print a message about how old the user will be in 10
years.

If it doesn\'t contain only numbers, we print a message letting the user
know that only numbers are allowed and recursively call the
`plusADecade` function to restart the program.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Important detail!: The last statement in a do block has to be an
expression that returns an IO action of the correct type.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
If we look at how the `plusADecade` function ends, we have two possible
cases depending if `validAge` is `True` or `False`.

Inside the `then`, we see a do block that ends with a `putStrLn` applied
to a string, so the expression is of type `IO ()` like we indicated at
the `plusADecade` signature. All good.

Inside the `else`, we see a do block that ends with a recursive call of
the `plusADecade` function, so it\'s of type `IO ()`. All good.

Of course, we couldn\'t have ended with something that returns a value
of type `IO Int` or `IO Bool`. But there\'s more! We can not do
something like this:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: IO String
twice = do
  str <- getLine
  let tw = str ++ str -- Error
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Why? Well, let\'s take a look at this code without all the sugary
syntax:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: IO String
twice =
  getLine >>= \str ->  
    let tw = str ++ str in -- Error
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
That\'s right! If we take a peek under the hood, we see that the `let`
binding expands to a complete `let` expression. And the problem is
evident: It\'s an incomplete expression! Let `tw` in what?

And that\'s when the brilliant idea that we all have when first learning
Haskell comes to mind. What if I return the `String` like this?
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="51" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: IO String
twice =
  getLine >>= \str -> 
    let tw = str ++ str in tw -- Error: Couldn't match type!
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The let expression is complete. But now we get a type error because we
have to return an `IO String`, and we\'re returning a pure `String`.
Easy fix! We can change the type of `twice` to `String` since that\'s
what we\'re returning!
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="50" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: String
twice =
  getLine >>= \str -> 
    let tw = str ++ str in tw  -- Error: Couldn't match type!
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
And, just for completeness, here\'s the equivalent code with do
notation:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: String
twice = do
  str <- getLine
  let tw = str ++ str -- tw :: String
  tw -- Error: Couldn't match type!
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
If we try to compile any of the last two versions of `twice`, we\'ll get
a type error. But we said that the type is String, and we\'re returning
a String. What\'s the problem?

The problem is that we used the `getLine` impure action inside twice,
and we\'re trying to return a pure value! In Haskell, once you go
impure, you can\'t go back. You can not ask for forgiveness, and
there\'s no redemption. In other words, you can\'t escape IO.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
### Escaping `IO` and the `return` function
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Just to make sure there\'s no confusion:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
**`return` DOES NOT WORK LIKE IN OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES! IT\'S A
DIFFERENT THING!**
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
If you don\'t know any other programming languages, don\'t worry about
it. I wanted to open with that to avoid confusion or in case you were
about to skip this section.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
OK, so let\'s go back to the problem at hand: Why doesn\'t this code
compile?:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: String
twice = do
  str <- getLine -- (str :: String) because (getLine :: IO String)
  let tw = str ++ str -- tw :: String
  tw -- Compiler error: Couldn't match type! 
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Because if we allow that to compile, for the one that uses the `twice`
function, it would look like it\'s using a pure function! Pure and
impure code would be able to mix without any way of differentiating
them! And if that\'s the case, we\'d never be sure if our code is pure,
which means that we\'d never know if our functions behave like we think
they do. We would have to treat everything as if it was impure, and
we\'d lose all the advantages of purity! No more referential
transparency, no more code that\'s easy to reason about, no more
certainty that modifying a function doesn\'t break anything without you
knowing about it, etc.

That\'s why we can not return a pure value if we perform an impure
action inside the function. There has to be a way for both the compiler
and developer to identify if we used an impure action.

The solution is simple: **Once we use any side effect, we will never be
able to escape impurity.**

How does this work in practice? Well, we can perform IO actions to get
the resulting value and work with it (like we did with `getLine` to
obtain `str`) as long as we do it inside another IO context! The
compiler enforces this by checking that: **A function performing an IO
action inside has to return an IO action.**

So:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: IO ... -- IO of something because we use getLine inside
twice = do
  str <- getLine -- getLine :: IO String
  let tw = str ++ str
  -- ... We have to do something else
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Because we performed the `getLine` action inside `twice`, now `twice`
has to return an `IO` action.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Ok, so we want to return `tw`. But `tw` is of type `String`, and we need
to return a value of type `IO String`. What can we do now?

That\'s when the `return` function comes in handy:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
return :: a -> IO a
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The `return` function injects a value inside an `IO` action that does
nothing. It takes a value of any type and returns an action that results
in that value.

Remember when we presented the idea of IO actions that we say they MAY
interact with the real world? Well, in this case, it doesn\'t. The
action returned by the `return` function is a dummy action that doesn\'t
produce any side effects and returns the value.

This is perfect for our use case. We need a value wrapped in an IO
action, but we don\'t need to perform any more actions.

So, using our new function, we obtain the final version of `twice`:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
twice :: IO String
twice = do
  str <- getLine
  let tw = str ++ str
  return tw
  
twice
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Which, without sugar, looks like this:
:::

::: {.cell .code scrolled="false" slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
twice' :: IO String
twice' =
  getLine >>= \str ->
    let tw = str ++ str in return tw

twice'
```

::: {.output .error ename="" evalue=""}
    <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
:::
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Remember that `return` is just a function. It doesn\'t need to be used
at the end, and you could use it multiple times like any other function.

And that\'s how we work with side effects.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
And you may be thinking: \"But, if, once we use an impure action, we
have to carry that IO type forever, where does it end? And if we need to
interact with the world at the beginning of our program, like when a
user clicks the start button, doesn\'t that mean that the whole program
would be impure?\"

Those are valid questions. Let\'s answer them one at a time.

Like many other programming languages, Haskell has what it\'s known as
an \"entry point\".
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
## The `main` action
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The entry point is the place in a program where its execution of it
begins. The first thing that runs when you run the program.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Many programming languages have entry points. And in almost all cases,
the entry point is named main. Sometimes it\'s a function, others a
static method. Rust, Java, Dart, C, C++, and many more have it. And, of
course, Haskell has it. In Haskell\'s case, its an IO action called
`main`:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
main :: IO ()
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This action is the only one that gets executed when we run any program
written in Haskell. And it always has the type `IO ()`. Actually, you
could return a value different than `()`, but it would get ignored
because there\'s nothing above this action. So there\'s no point.

Now, when you interact with the outside world and have to carry out the
`IO` type, that\'s where it ends. In the main action.

An important thing to know is that if you want a function or action to
be evaluated and performed when running your program, it has to
be---directly or indirectly---inside `main`. When composing actions and
functions, in the end, we\'re gluing everything together in a single
`IO ()` action that, when run, performs everything as we specified.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Why do we hear about this just now? Because we\'ve been using GHCi that
handles this behind the scenes. But, next lesson, we\'ll start working
with real compiled programs. So we better start practicing now.

On that note, let me present to you one of the shortest programs you
could write in Haskell:
:::

::: {.cell .code slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
``` haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
This is it! A complete Haskell program! You could put this in a Haskell
file and compile it using `ghc fileName.hs`, and you would get a program
that prints `"Hello World!"` when executed!
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Ok, so if every time you perform an action, you have to carry the IO,
and the first thing a Haskell program runs is an action that has all the
code inside\... At which moment do we write pure code?
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
Haskell programs in the real world usually have a small `main` function
with a couple of actions and pure functions. And inside those pure
functions is where the bulk of the code lives. That way, you minimize
the interaction with side effects, and most of your code is pure and
easy to deal with.

Sort of like this:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"slide\"}"}
``` haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  config <- getConfig              -- Custom IO action
  let result = pureFunction config -- Huge pure function
  putStrLn $ "Done! The result is: " ++ show result
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
The bulk of the code is pure and inside the `pureFunction` that takes a
pure `config` value. And a small part of the program interacts with the
real world to get the configuration and show the final result.

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"notes\"}"}
And that\'s pretty much everything I wanted to cover for this lesson.
It\'s a lot to take in, but with everything we covered today and a
little practice, you\'ll have no issues writing interactive programs!

And because I know we covered a lot of new concepts and syntax, here\'s
a recap to use as a refresher while working on the homework:

## Pure VS Impure IO recap:
:::

::: {.cell .markdown slideshow="{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}"}
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pure                                Impure
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Always produces the same result     May produce different results for
  when given the same parameters      the same parameters

  Never has side effects              May have side effects

  Never alters state                  May alter the global state of the
                                      program, system, or world

  Doesn\'t have `IO`                  Has `IO`

  Functions behave nicely             Be extra careful

  `>>`                                Sequentially composes two actions,
                                      discarding any value produced by
                                      the first

  `>>=`                               Sequentially composes two actions,
                                      forwarding the value produced by
                                      the first to the second

  `return`                            Function to inject a value inside a
                                      context

  `do`                                Start a `do` block

  `<-`                                Inside the `do` block: Bind result
                                      of performing an action

  `let`                               Inside the `do` block: Lazy binding
                                      of any expression (it doesn\'t
                                      perform actions)

  `main`                              The entry point of a Haskell
                                      program. (All functions/actions end
                                      in `main`.)

And that\'s it for today! If you\'re curious about how to create your
own programs, don\'t worry. Next lesson, we\'ll learn how to set up our
own local development environment, how to use modules, and how to manage
Haskell projects. We\'ll still provide everything in online Jupyter
notebooks and online development environments, but we\'ll remove all
training wheels so you can manage your projects by yourself if you want
to.

Make sure to complete your homework, and I\'ll see you on the next one!
