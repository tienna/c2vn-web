## CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY

- Every year, we have the opportunity to engage with thousands of students majoring in Information Technology. They are third and fourth-year students from major universities in Vietnam. At these universities, we are supporting the development of Blockchain course frameworks, curricula, student clubs, and training. Below are some images [depicting our activities](https://www.cardano2vn.io/docs/Cardano4uni/daihoc-kinhte-kythuat-congnghiep)
