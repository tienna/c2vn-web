## Our Past Activities and Achievements


- Every year, we have the opportunity to engage with thousands of students majoring in Information Technology. They are third and fourth-year students from major universities in Vietnam. At these universities, we are supporting the development of Blockchain course frameworks, curricula, student clubs, and training. Below are some images [depicting our activities](https://www.cardano2vn.io/docs/Cardano4uni/daihoc-kinhte-kythuat-congnghiep)



![UNETI](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/community-id/163/attachments/embedded-files/embedded-idea-custom-field-image-f8c0e5/png)


- Track Record: We have a proven track record of [successfully executing projects in the Project Catalyst](https://www.cardano2vn.io/docs/be-apart-of-governance/overview). Our achievements include creating an [online blockchain technical center](https://www.cardano2vn.io/), training students in blockchain basics, [Web3-bootcamp](https://forum.cardano.org/t/web3-bootcamp-s-ki-n-cho-sinh-vien-va-c-ng-d-ng/117201/1), winning prizes in [Student scientific research](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-student-showcases-at-student-scientific-and-research-conference-at-the-university-of-transport-and-communications-in-hanoi-vietnam/118981), organizing community-led events like the Cardano [Summit 2022](https://www.cardano2vn.io/docs/Cardano-summit-2022/Cardano-summit-2022-hanoi) and organizing community-led events like the Cardano [Summit 2023](https://www.cardano2vn.io/docs/Cardano-summit-2023/Cardano-summit-2023-hanoi).

- Supporting students in conducting scientific research on blockchain, building, and integrating their [applications with Cardano](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-student-showcases-at-student-scientific-and-research-conference-at-the-university-of-transport-and-communications-in-hanoi-vietnam/118981)
- Organizing and participating in “[Together we learn Haskell](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cung-nhau-h-c-haskell/112470/15)”
- Introduce and promote [Blockchain and AI](https://forum.cardano.org/t/continue-to-promote-blockchain-and-ai-research-in-universities/119156/1) research and development to Universities

- At Fund 13, we received support and funding from the community and Catalyst to organize the "Cardano Blockchain Programming Course," which attracted a large number of university lecturers and members of the developer community in Vietnam. Details of the course can be found [here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-blockchain-programming-course/144051)

- Community Involvement: We actively participate in the Cardano community as [Plutus Pioneer Program members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaQQUVBeNvE&list=PLbQhX3HIoPxq8kd04oEQXRihLc2wO-2LV&index=18), stake pool operators, and moderators. Our involvement demonstrates our commitment to the ecosystem and our understanding of its dynamics and requirements.

- Network and Partnerships: We have established partnerships and collaborations with universities, technical experts, and Cardano-related organizations. These connections enhance our capabilities and enable us to tap into a wider pool of knowledge and resources. We established the University Blockchain Alliance (([UBA](https://uba.edu.vn/)) to connect and share blockchain knowledge among University of Transport and Communications ([UTC](https://forum.cardano.org/t/k-t-qua-nghien-c-u-khoa-h-c-c-a-sinh-vien-tr-ng-d-i-h-c-giao-thong-v-n-t-i-2024/131620)), East Asia University of Technology ([EAUT](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano2vn-h-p-tac-phat-tri-n-dao-t-o-blockchain-t-i-tr-ng-d-i-h-c-kinh-t-k-thu-t-cong-nghi-p-uneti/145026)), University of Economics - Technology for Industries ([UNETI](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano2vn-h-p-tac-phat-tri-n-dao-t-o-blockchain-t-i-tr-ng-d-i-h-c-kinh-t-k-thu-t-cong-nghi-p-uneti/145026)), Phuong Dong University, and the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT)...

- Project Management Skills: Our team has strong project management skills, ensuring efficient planning, monitoring, and execution of projects. We are adept at handling budgets, adhering to timelines, mitigating risks, and maintaining effective communication with stakeholders.

- Transparency and Accountability: We prioritize transparency and accountability in our project delivery. We are committed to providing regular updates, maintaining open communication channels, and addressing any concerns or issues promptly. Our track record of delivering projects on time and meeting the expectations of the community.
Therefore, we have confidence in managing the project budget correctly and efficiently. We also assure that we are suitable for and capable of executing this project well.
